# ROS-2-Turtlesim-Shape-Drawing-Service
This project shows how to build a ROS 2 service-based system where a client requests a geometric shape and a server controls the Turtlesim turtle to draw it. When the turtle finishes drawing, the server sends back a response with the shape name and its dimensions.
